# Horiseon-Accessibility-Code Refactor

## Project Intro
Accessibility standards for websites are incredibly important in order for websites to be accesible for all users, especially those with impairments or disabilities. The Horiseon website was lacking accessibility functionality in several areas that created a poor user experience for those users who may need to use a screen reader. Addressing and fixing these issues will result in better SEO optimization and a better user experience. 

## Project Goals
Our goal was to improve the accessibility and construction of the Horiseon website in several key areas:

1. Ensuring all images contained descriptive alt tags.
2. Improving the structure of the HTML by replacing generic elements with semantic alternatives to provide clarity about the flow of the website. 
3. Refactor the CSS code in order to provide more maintainable and understandable code outline.
